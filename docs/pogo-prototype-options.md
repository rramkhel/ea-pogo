## **üí¨ HOW TO POSITION IT IN YOUR EMAIL**

**Subject:** Data-driven PM with Interactive Demo for Pogo Live Service Team

Hi Sean,

I saw your post about hiring PMs for Pogo and was excited by the focus on data-driven decision making for live service optimization.

I spent 4 years at Chegg launching AI products (100K users <1 month, 63% conversion lift) through continuous experimentation and behavioral analytics. What drew me to Pogo is the challenge of optimizing engagement for a 26-year heritage brand with 60+ games.

**I built an interactive dashboard showing how I'd track live service health for Pogo** ‚Üí [link]

It visualizes the key metrics I'd focus on (DAU/MAU ratio, retention curves, cross-game engagement, Club Pogo conversion funnel) with mock data to tell a story.

Would love to chat about Pogo's roadmap and how I could contribute to the team.

Best,
[Your name]

## **ALTERNATIVE: Combine Options**

If you have more time (20-24 hours total):

**Build Dashboard + Simple Game**
- Dashboard shows the data
- Mini-game demonstrates the mechanic you're analyzing
- "Here's what I'd measure (dashboard) and here's what I'd build (game)"
- Creates a complete product story

---

Want me to help you build the dashboard? I can start by creating the basic structure and charts with mock Pogo data!
