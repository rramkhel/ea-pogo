About
As a passionate Product Manager with a strong foundation in the gaming industry, I thrive on leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. My career is driven by the belief that technology should not only advance but also preserve the human elements that make us unique.

Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the industry, from work experiences and university to my background in hockey. These diverse experiences have taught me the value of learning from failures and continuously striving for excellence.

With a keen interest in Finance and Business Technology Management, I am committed to expanding my knowledge and expertise. My leadership skills have been honed through active involvement in sports, professional settings, and volunteering. I pride myself on my ability to take initiative, fuel projects with passion, and drive them to successful completion.

For example, I led a cross-functional team to develop a webstore feature that increased net revenue by 22%. I am always eager to connect with others in the tech community, explore new opportunities, and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of innovation.

I am excited about the future of technology and look forward to exploring opportunities that allow me to continue growing and making a significant impact.
