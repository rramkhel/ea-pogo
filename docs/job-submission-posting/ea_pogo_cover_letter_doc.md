**Sean Evans, Product Director**  
**EA Mobile - Pogo**  
**Electronic Arts**

Dear Sean,

I'm Rachel, a PM with 8+ years of experience delivering sticky, engaging experiences to users, and I'm reaching out because I would love to work in Product on Electronic Arts's Pogo team, building snappy, engaging gaming content. I've successfully adapted to many data-based, user-centric challenges (delivering 2x WAU targets of 50%+, increasing user satisfation to 85%, driving 63% conversion boosts), and have driven many successful features through innovation and team collaboration. I'd love to do this as part of your team at EA!

## Why I'm Excited About This Role

What draws me to Pogo is the continuous optimization challenge: delivering daily reasons for players to engage, using data to inform roadmap decisions, and balancing fresh content with platform stability. At Chegg, I launched a content platform to 100K+ users and drove adoption from 0% to 50%+ weekly active users (exceeding 25% target by 2x) through behavioral analytics and rapid experimentation.

The cross-platform complexity is particularly compelling. I orchestrated the migration of 1M+ live content pieces with zero downtime for 400K+ users, coordinating engineering, QA, and operations teams on tight timelines—I understand maintaining uptime while shipping improvements.

## How My Experience Translates

The product fundamentals that drive success in EdTech translate directly to live service gaming:

**Data-Driven Optimization**: I worked in Amplitude daily, utilizing user event tracking, running continuous A/B tests (3-5 per sprint), and translating complex datasets into roadmap priorities—driving 63% conversion boost, 25% MAU growth, and 15% retention lift.

**Daily Engagement & Platform Operations**: I designed features to bring users back every day (achievement tracking, progressive difficulty, personalized recommendations) and built a compliance framework for 300K expert contributors with in-platform assessment tools that maintained quality standards at scale.

**Cross-Functional Execution & Subscription Optimization**: I coordinated engineering, UX, legal, and marketing teams to ship complex features under tight deadlines (improving roadmap predictability by 85%) while analyzing acquisition costs, lifetime value, and engagement patterns to inform pricing experiments that improved conversion rates.

## Why This Transition Excites Me

I'm energized by the opportunity to apply my product toolkit to a new domain. EdTech and casual gaming share fundamental user motivations like achievement, progression, mastery, and building daily habits that feel rewarding. I also thrive on diving deep into new spaces: at Chegg, I quickly became the go-to expert on STEM content quality standards and large scale platform operations, domains I had never worked in before.

I'm particularly excited about learning from your team's years of gaming expertise. The best product managers combine domain knowledge with transferable PM fundamentals, and I will bring the latter while rapidly building the former alongside your team.

## Let's Connect

I've actually done a quick exploration and rapid prototype showing some innovative features I think could be useful, both to an internal team for improving data analysis, and to users: 

I'd love to learn more about Pogo's vision for the next phase of growth. Would you be open to a conversation about how I can contribute to Pogo's live service roadmap?


Best regards,
